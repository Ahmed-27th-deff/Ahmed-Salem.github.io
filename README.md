## Work Experience  

### Computer Vision Intern – NTI (Online)  
*Jul 2025 – Aug 2025*  

- Built and fine‑tuned deep‑learning models for **object detection** and **image classification** using **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, and **YOLOv5**.  
- Pre‑processed and augmented **>20 000** images to improve model accuracy and generalization.  
- Applied **transfer learning** on pre‑trained models, achieving **+7 %** accuracy improvement over the baseline.  
- Developed a multilingual **NLP pipeline** for question answering using **BERT** and **FAISS** for semantic search.  
- Collaborated with other interns via **Git/GitHub** and managed experiments in **Docker** environments for reproducibility.  

### Mobile Development Intern – DEPI, YAT (El Maadi, Cairo)  
*Nov 2024 – May 2025*  

- Developed multiple Android apps with **Kotlin** and cross‑platform apps with **Flutter**.  
- Integrated **Firebase Authentication**, **Firestore**, and **Cloud Storage** for secure data handling and real‑time sync.  
- Built AI‑powered features (image classification & object detection) using **TensorFlow Lite**.  
- Optimized app performance by reducing API calls and caching frequently used data.  
- Followed **Agile** methodology, delivering tasks on time across weekly sprints.
